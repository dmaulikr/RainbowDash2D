Rainbow Dash 2D
===============

So I says, "I need to make a toy iPhone game. What ever shall I do?"
and she says, "Well it should probably include rainbows and stars and magical ponies."

At some point, this will include Rainbow Dash doing cloud control (you'll get it if you watch My Little Pony).

For now, it includes memory leaks, blatant disregard of the glory that is Objective-C properties, and no sparkles (it needs more sparkles).
